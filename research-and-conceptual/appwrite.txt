+Appwrtie training/research

+To learn in Appwrite (BaaS) is the platform that fits our needs.

+I expect to learn the basics of the capabilities of Appwrite, not necessarily how to implement it. I will figure out implementation
play-by-play.

+I need it to be able to keep record of player & DM information. Everything within our application will have a direct or indirect reliance
on this technology. Critical to ensure it is the platform for us.
