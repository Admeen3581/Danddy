Title or name of research/training:
    Auth Respective messaging research

Why you are doing it.
    Team has no knowledge of how to develop a user-to-user messaging system; therefore, I will be researching & developing the end product. We need a
    messaging system to allow users to privately communicate.

What you expect to learn/do.   Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.
    I expect to learn and implement message history & logging with the database (SCRUM-35), create a UI component using shadCn (SCRUM-113), place new
    buttons on the existing UI (SCRUM-111 & SCRUM-112), build messaging receiving (SCRUM-115), build message sending (SCRUM-116), and use notifications
    (SCRUM-33).

What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient. "Writing the
Login class" is.
    I will need to write a UI component using the shadCn library that will hold the messaging system pop-up. I will need to modify 'dmhome/page.tsx' and
    'playerhome/page.tsx' to add a button to trigger the popup component. I will add database collections & documents to holster the message system & log
    the data. I will need to create a custom component to place a notification badge on the buttons mentioned above.

What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.
    SCRUM-33, SCRUM-35, SCRUM-111, SCRUM-112, SCRUM-113, SCRUM-115, SCRUM-116.
